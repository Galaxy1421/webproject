                <h2>ᯓ★ What Is a Galaxy?</h2>
                <p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way, and it contains our solar system and planet Earth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="more-about-galaxies">
                <h2>ᯓ★ Galaxies shapes</h2>
                <p>Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved
                    arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other galaxies are
                    smooth and oval shaped. They're called elliptical galaxies. And
                    there are also galaxies that aren't spirals or ovals. They have
                    irregular shapes and look like blobs. The light that we see from
                    each of these galaxies comes from the stars inside it.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>ᯓ★ How many galaxies?</h2>
                    <p>There are many galaxies besides ours, though. There are so
                        many, we can't even count them all yet! The Hubble Space
                        Telescope looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and
                        found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some
                        scientists think there could be as many as one hundred billion
                        galaxies in the universe.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>ᯓ★ More About galaxies</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes galaxies get too close and smash into each other.
                        Our Milky Way galaxy will someday bump into Andromeda, our
                        closest galactic neighbor. But don't worry. It won't happen for
                        about five billion years. But even if it happened tomorrow, you
                        might not notice. Galaxies are so big and spread out at the ends
                        that even though galaxies bump into each other, the planets and
                        solar systems often don't get close to colliding.</p>

                <h2>Milky Way</h2>
                <p>Our home galaxy is called the <strong>Milky Way</strong>. It’s a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way just once.<br><br>From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its name.</p>

                <h2>Antennae Galaxies</h2>
                <p><strong>The Antennae Galaxies,</strong> also known as the Ringtail Galaxy, are a pair of colliding galaxies located in the constellation Corvus. The collision has produced two long tails of stars.<br><br>The Antennae Galaxies are one of the youngest examples of colliding galaxies, as well as one of the nearest pairs of interacting galaxies to Earth. The merging galaxies reveal a likely future of the Milky Way when it collides with the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) in several billion years.</p>

                <h2>The Leo Triplet of Galaxies</h2>
                <p><strong>The Leo Triplet</strong> is an interesting group of 3 galaxies that are often observed and photographed within a single field of view.

                    The Leo Triplet includes spiral galaxies M65, M66, and NGC 3628. This group of galaxies is also known as the M66 group, and is found in the constellation Leo. 
                    
                    Each one of the galaxies is tilted at a different angle, making them all appear quite different from each other from our vantage point on Earth.</p>

                <p><strong>The Andromeda Galaxy,</strong> also called Messier 31 or M31, our nearest large neighbor galaxy {the Milky Way} , Visible to the naked eye even under moderate conditions, this object was known as the "little cloud" to the Persian astronomer Abd-al-Rahman Al-Sufi, who described and depicted it in 964 AD in his Book of Fixed Stars.</p>

It was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel on 20 October 1784.<br><br><br><br><strong>NGC 1232A </strong> is a satellite galaxy of NGC 1232.
