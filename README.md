## Detailed Documentation:

### fetchVotes.js Summary:

The `fetchVotes.js` connects to a MongoDB database, retrieves all documents from the `nobulaVote` collection within the `Vote` database, and prints the retrieved documents to the console. It handles potential errors during the process and ensures that the database connection is properly closed after the operation is completed.
