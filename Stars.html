                <h2>ᯓ★ What are Stars?</h2>
                <p>Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars – that’s a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.<br><br>Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="how-stars-form">
                <h2>ᯓ★ Birth of a star?</h2>
                <p>Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Molecular clouds range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years. Molecular clouds are cold which causes gas to clump, creating high-density pockets. Some of these clumps can collide with each other or collect more matter, strengthening their gravitational force as their mass grows. Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, which eventually leads to the development of a protostar – a baby star.                </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>ᯓ★ Life of a star?</h2>
            <p>At first, most of the protostar’s energy comes from heat released by its initial collapse. After millions of years, immense pressures and temperatures in the star’s core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to form helium, a process called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion releases energy, which heats the star and prevents it from further collapsing under the force of gravity.<br><br>Astronomers call stars that are stably undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium main sequence stars. This is the longest phase of a star’s life. The star’s luminosity, size, and temperature will slowly change over millions or billions of years during this phase. Our Sun is roughly midway through its main sequence stage.<br><br>A star’s gas provides its fuel, and its mass determines how rapidly it runs through its supply, with lower-mass stars burning longer, dimmer, and cooler than very massive stars.  Some low-mass stars will shine for trillions of years – longer than the universe has currently existed – while some massive stars will live for only a few million years (★ᴗ★)</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>ᯓ★ Death of a star?</h2>
            <p>At the end of a star's life, its core runs out of hydrogen, leading to a collapse that triggers fusion of helium into heavier elements. Low-mass stars become giants and shed their outer layers, forming planetary <strong>nebulae</strong> (⸝⸝•ᴗ•⸝⸝), leaving behind a white dwarf. High-mass stars continue fusion, forming heavier elements until iron, leading to a supernova explosion. The core collapses to form a neutron star or black hole, while the material ejected enriches future star formation. </p>
